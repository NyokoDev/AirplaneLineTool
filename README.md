# CSMod-TLM - Transport Lines Manager Mod
A shortcut to manage all city's public transports lines. Now in his (basic) final version! 

Now we can change the name, the number and the color of the line, also see its statics direct on this panel. Added a delete line button too.

# How does this work

When you click on the button in the top left corner and a window will open. Each button is a line of the public transport of the city: 

- B lines are buses lines 
- T lines are train lines 
- M lines are metro/subway lines 

The number after the letter is the internal line number of the line in game. 
The background color is the line color. 

# Next steps:
- Do stops listing and name editing; 
- Do stops navigation; 
- Study about vehicle distribution by line; 

# Known bugs:

- When you load a new city inside game, the button not work anymore. Solved at 1.0 

# Reported incompatible mods:
- Slow Speed (TLM 1.1.1 > *)
